VVV ASS
=======

This is a repository of my [Auto-site Setups](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv/wiki/Auto-site-Setup) for [Vagrant](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV). You can't use these without VVV. Well. Someone could. They're here, free to use and expand on as you like.

Included are two Multisites and a plugin test bed.

* http://multisite.dev - Subdomain Multisite (/www/wordpress-musubdomain). Predefined vhost subdomains but did not build out: foo, bar, and baz.
* http://folder.multisite.dev - Subfolder Multisite (/www/wordpress-mufolder)
* http://local.plugins.dev - Plugin tests (/www/wordpress-plugins)

The basic design of my scripts are from [Luke Woodward's auto setup scripts](https://github.com/lkwdwrd/vvv-auto-setup)
